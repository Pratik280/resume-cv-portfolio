**Subject: Application for Java Backend Engineer Role**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Java Backend Engineer position at your organization. I bring 3.9+ years of professional experience designing and developing scalable Java (8/11/17) backend systems, Spring Boot microservices, and RESTful APIs for high-availability transaction-processing platforms in the banking and payments domain.

In my current role, I design and build production-grade Spring Boot microservices using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and event-driven architectures powered by Kafka. I have hands-on experience implementing secure API gateway architectures, schema-based multi-tenancy, Redis caching strategies, and database-driven backend platforms using PostgreSQL. Additionally, I actively contribute to CI/CD automation using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud-native deployments across Azure and AWS environments.

Beyond development, I participate across the full SDLC including system design discussions, code reviews, performance optimization, production troubleshooting, and mentoring junior developers while collaborating closely with product, QA, and DevOps teams.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my backend engineering expertise, microservices experience, and performance-focused development approach to your engineering team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Pratik Chandlekar**
