## About

```
Software Engineer with hands-on experience building production-grade microservices in Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud. I’ve worked end-to-end on designing secure, scalable systems — from API design and database architecture to deployment, observability, and production support.

My work includes building real-time transaction monitoring systems backed by PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka, powering React and Angular dashboards used for merchant operations and live monitoring. I’ve designed high-availability architectures using Spring Cloud Gateway, peer-aware Eureka clusters, and Nginx load balancing, and implemented schema-based multitenancy after evaluating database sharding trade-offs.

I also have strong exposure to DevOps and cloud-native practices, including CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Dockerized microservices, Helm-based deployments on AKS, Kafka migration to KRaft mode, and centralized logging and observability using ELK, Prometheus, and Grafana. Comfortable working on Linux, handling production issues, and collaborating in Agile teams while mentoring juniors and participating in code reviews.

I actively write technical blogs on backend engineering and system design, documenting real-world learnings from production systems.
Always interested in solving backend, platform, and distributed systems problems.
