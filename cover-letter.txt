Dear Hiring Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at your organization. I have over three years of experience building production-grade backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture, primarily working in the banking and payments domain on transaction processing and monitoring platforms.

In my current role, I design and develop scalable REST APIs, work with distributed systems using Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL, and contribute to secure, highly available microservices deployments along with CI/CD and containerized environments. I am also actively involved in performance optimization and resolving production-critical issues in Agile delivery environments. 

I am highly motivated to leverage my backend engineering and domain experience to contribute to building reliable, scalable software solutions within your organization.

Please find my resume attached for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your requirements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
