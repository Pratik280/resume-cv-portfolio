**Subject: Application for Java Full-Stack Engineer Role**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Java Full-Stack Engineer position at your organization. With 3.9+ years of experience building end-to-end enterprise applications using Java (8/11/17), Spring Boot microservices, and modern frontend frameworks such as React and Angular, I bring strong hands-on expertise across both backend services and frontend integrations.

In my current role, I develop Spring Boot microservices, REST APIs, and responsive UI modules that power real-time transaction monitoring platforms. My experience includes designing scalable microservices architectures, implementing secure API gateways, integrating frontend dashboards with backend services, and building cloud-native deployments using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines. I also work extensively with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka-based event streaming, and performance optimization for high-traffic applications.

I enjoy collaborating across product, QA, and DevOps teams throughout the full software development lifecycle, contributing to architecture discussions, mentoring engineers, and ensuring the delivery of secure, scalable, and maintainable applications.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my full-stack engineering expertise and problem-solving skills to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,<br>
