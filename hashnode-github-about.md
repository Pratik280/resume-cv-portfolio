## Software Engineer | Backend, Microservices & Devops

I’m a **Software Engineer** building **production-grade backend systems** with a strong focus on **Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud microservices**, primarily in **fintech and transaction-heavy environments**.

My work focuses on designing **reliable, secure, and scalable** backend services that hold up under real-world usage.

I enjoy working close to the core of the system — shaping APIs, data models, and service interactions — and thinking through the trade-offs that come with building distributed systems. Over time, working with live systems has taught me the importance of observability, fault tolerance, and simplicity in design.

I’m most comfortable working on **backend and cloud-native** systems using modern engineering practices, collaborating closely with teams, and taking ownership of features from development through production.
